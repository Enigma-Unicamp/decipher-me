Decipher Me is a free and open web framework to host Jeopardy-style Capture The
Flag contests.

## What is a _Capture The Flag_?

CTF is a information security and hacking competition. Among the common types,
there is the Jeopardy style, where teams must solve tasks in a
range of categories, earning points for different tasks. The categories
mostly include Web Exploitation, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering and
Forensic. More info [here](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).
